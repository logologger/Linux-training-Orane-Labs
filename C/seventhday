The Header file limits.h contains all the major maximum and minimum values for the data types

For Example 
INT_MAX,INT_MIN,FLT_MAX,FLT_MIN etc

getopt(argc,argv,option pattern)

An option followed by : represents that option expects a value or arguments after it

getopt returns -1 then there are no options which are left to be read
When getopt returns ? then it means that are unrecognized option which is stored in the optopt variable

getopt(argc,argv,"ls:ef");
s option takes an argument or value which is stored in the optarg variable

getopt function is defined in the unistd.h header file
unistd header is actually not a part of standard C Library.It was created to implement some of the POSIX standards
POSIX were a set of standard that were created to run commands in all machines 

A colon following an option in the string in getopt means that the option takes an additional arguments

getopt() will record the options argument using the optarg variable

After you have read all the option you should skip them using the optind variable

TEMPORARY FILES

Often ,programs will need to make use of temporary programs in the form of files
Thes might hold intermdeiate results of computation or represent backup copies files made before critical operations
The serious issue is that each temp file should have a new and unique name

#include<stdio.h>
char * tmpname(char * s);
