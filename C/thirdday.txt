Pointer arithematic

Now 
*(a+1) is technically equal to a[1]

*(a+1) also means that it is pointing to the next memory address
for char it is plus 1
for integer it is plus 4

Now here is something that should be know by us

doses[3]=3[doses]=*(doses+3)=*(3+doses)

You should know the basic difference between the array variables and pointer variables

Now Array variables can be used as pointers
but variables arent quit the same 

sizeof(array) is different for pointer and array

Array variables cant point to anything else

Passing an array variable to pointer (I mean assigning it) to a pointer variable decays it
