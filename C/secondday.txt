======================2nd DAY======================================

This is the 2nd day of  mine


Look at the example given in the page 57 
there is an array contestants 

contestansts[0]=2;

*choice = contestants;

What does choice stores ?

choice stores the base address of the array that is the address of the contestants[0]

So if you print the value of choice then its value is 2 =contestants

array[i]=*(array+i)

DIfference between array variable and pointer

---1st basic statement is that array variables arent pointers(True upto somewhat limit )

1.Basic difference is you can see in the sizeof(Array) and sizeof(pointer)

example 
char *str1="This is a test"
char str2[]="This is a test"

sizeof(str2)=15
sizeof(str1)=4 or 8

2.The address of the array....is the address of the array

By this i mean to say that 

char s[]="This is a test"

s and &s are same

s==&s are technically same because address of array  variable is the base address of the array i.e.address of s[0] is the address of the array which is defined in the array variable s and thus it can be said as equal to &s.


BUT 
consider a vatiable t 
it reperesents itself as a variable and &t here represents the address of the variable t which are equal in both cases

3. An array variable cant point anywhere else.
