=======This is first night ..I am going to learn C=============

GCC --Gnu Compiler Collection 
Why Collection ?
Because it can be used to compiler many languages

C programs gets Compiler so that they can run faster ....Other languages like javascript and python even use some sort of hidden Compilation

For Proper Compilation and execution of C program the synatax is

gcc program.c -o program && ./program

break statement is only used for loop and switch statements only 

Break statement dont break if Statements

C uses \0 to recognize the end of the string
\0 is an ASCII character with value 0 
C coders call this as null characters
\0 also called as sentinel character

================================POINTERS==========================


Pointer is just the address of a peice of data in memory

How useful ??
Instead of  just passing whole copy of data just pass the address or pointer

Before Understanding Pointer we will look into the memory of the computer 

Stack =====================
Heap  ===============================
Globals ========
Constants =========
Code  ===============

%p is the foramat specifier for pointer

A variable declared inside a stack is usually inside a stack

If u want to find the memory address of the variable x we will use &x

& operator finds the address of the variable

* operator can read the contents of a memory address

* operator can also set the contents of a memory address

In layman terms pointers are just variables that stores memory addresses
 
sizeof -------

it is an OPERATOR not a FUNCTION

An operator is compiled to a sequence of instruction by the compiler while in function calling it has to jump to a seperate peice of code in the memory 

Array name is actually a pointer pointing to the address of the first variable.

Pointer is actually a variable that stores the address of the first variable

------------sizeof(pointer) 
Its answer depends on the architecture of the machine 
for 32 bit system it is 4
for 64 bit system it is 8

Array variables are not pointers ----sizeof
