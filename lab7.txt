#include "stdio.h" is for local headers and #include<stdio.h> is for library headers

Difference between static library and shared library is that

In static library it just copies the object modules from the library into the executables as it is 
while in shared library the linker just writes a record into the executable to indicate that at run time the executable needs to use that shared library  

There is a program called dynamic linker that ensures that the shared libraries required by the executables are found and loaded into the memory
